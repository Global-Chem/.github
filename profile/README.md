# Welcome

Welcome to our Global-Chem Repository where we run our organization. Please browse through and follow our community guidelines on how to contribute. Thank you.

### Step 1: Gathering Chemical Data From People

We don't need all the chemicals in the universe, only the best elected from each community: War, Sex, Cannabis, Medicinal Therapeutics, Vaccines, Narcotics, Food etc.

### Step 2: Develop an Open Source Government

We link communities together by sharing chemical data across companies, academica, industry, and the people. This establishes a foundation for a government where the data is governed by everyone

### Step 3: Establish A Standard Artifical Chemical Intelligence

We create interfaces where machine learning models and the users can interact with, and contribute back, data. This establishes a practice for a standard artificial intelligence program to be governed by all.
